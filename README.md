This is a simple dotnet core project example of how to build and run tests using the gitlab ci. The solution is from [these Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/tutorials/using-with-xplat-cli#using-folders-to-organize-code). The solution is less important than the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, which is the focus of this repo.

Couple of things to take note of:

* When figuring this out, I only used gitlab.com, so this has not been tested on a local deployment (though I don't believe there should be a problem).
* I am also checking out gitlab.com's mirroring functionality, so the main repo is located [here](https://gitlab.com/forrestab/dotnet-gitlab-ci) (_I am leaving issues open on both repos_).
